# IRISLCD User Guide

## Basic Functionality Description

1. Provide restful APIs and swagger-ui to show these APIs
2. Verify query proof

## Usage Scenario

Suppose an IRISLCD node is running and its swagger-ui page url is `localhost:1317/swagger-ui/`. The default home folder of irislcd is `$HOME/.irislcd`. Once an IRISLCD is started, firstly it will create key store in its home folder. If the IRISLCD is running in distrust mode, then ir will fetch the latest block as its trust basis and the trust basis will be saved to folder `trust-base.db` under its home folder. The IRISLCD node always trust the basis. It will verify all query proof against the trust basis, which means IRISLCD can only verify the proof on later height. However, this is also a defect of IRISLCD. When it tries to verify some transactions or blocks on lower height, it will report error. So if you want to query transactions or block on lower height, please start IRISLCD in trust mode. For detailed proof verification algorithm please refer to this [document](https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/blob/master/docs/tendermint-core/light-client-protocol.md).

Once the IRISLCD node is started successfully, then you can open `localhost:1317/swagger-ui/` in your explorer and all restful APIs will be shown.

| parameter name   | Type | Default | Priority | Description                 |
| --------------- | ---- | ------- |--------- |--------------------------- |
| generate-only   | bool | false | 0 | Build an unsigned transaction and write it back |
| simulate        | bool | false | 1 | Ignore the gas field and perform a simulation of a transaction, but donâ€™t broadcast it |
| async           | bool | false | 2 | Broadcast transaction asynchronously   |

The above eight post APIs have three query parameter which are shown in the above table. By default, their values are all false. Each parameter has its unique priority( Here `0` is the top priority). If multiple parameters are specified, then the parameters with lower priority will be ignored. For instance, if `generate-only` is true, then other parameters, such as `simulate` and `async` will be ignored.
